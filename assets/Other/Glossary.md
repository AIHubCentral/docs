###### ‎
### Backing vocals
Vocal lines that contribute to the sound of the lead vocals in a song.      
***
###### ‎
### Closed-source
Software whose author owns all rights to use, modify, and copy it, and the public cannot see or modify the code.    
The opposite of [<u>open-source</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#open-source).        
***
###### ‎
### Cloud-based
Any software or application that's stored, managed, and available through the provider's virtual servers, and is accessed through a web browser.        
The opposite of [<u>local running</u>](http://localhost:5000/Docs/other/glossary/#local-running).          
***
###### ‎       
### Compression
In the field of audio data, compression is the process of reducing the data of an audio file.            
The compression can either be [<u>lossy</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/#lossy-formats) or [<u>lossless</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/#lossless-formats).        
***
###### ‎       
### CPU
Is the main brain on the computer which processes all the information thats currently running, like programs and user inputs.        
***
###### ‎       
### CUDA
A technology developed by NVIDIA, that uses the power of graphics cards to perform calculations that require great processing power.    
It's especially useful for AI tools, such as RVC and UVR.        

If possible, we recommend using CUDA to optimize the process of training models.           

CUDA is downloaded automatically as a part of the NVIDIA driver.            
***
###### ‎       
### DAW
It stands for **Digital Audio Workstation**, and it's any software used for making and mixing music.    

For **basic audio editing**, we recommend [<u>Audacity</u>](https://www.audacityteam.org/).     
For **professional mixing**/music production, [<u>FL Studio</u>](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/).        
***
###### ‎       
### Fork
It's a copy of a main GitHub project. It aims to make a different version of the project with improvements, changes & new features.       
***
###### ‎
### Google Colab
Google Colaboratory is a product of Google that allows anybody to write & execute arbitrary python code through websites.     

Cloud RVC users mainly use it for the RVC ports, like [<u>AICoverGen NO UI</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/inference/aicovergen-no-ui/), [<u>Ilaria RVC</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/inference/ilaria-rvc/), & [<u>RVC Disconnected</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/training/rvc-disconnected/).    

Colab is free, but its free version is slower & with a usage limit of **6 hours per day**. When you ran out of it you'll have to wait 24 hours.     
You can upgrade to a paid option for a better version too. 
***
###### ‎       
### GPU
It stands for Graphics Processing Unit. It's designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate creation of images.    

In AI training, is used for quick parallel independent computations, which increases the speed substantially.     

Basically the speed at which RVC/UVR will work will depend on how good your GPU is.       
***
###### ‎       
### Hugging Face
It's a free, open-source online platform for hosting interactive AI apps, models and datasets.      

The RVC ports hosted here are a great alternative to Google Colab, since by default it has a user-friendly UI & no usage limit. 

Only downside is you can't train models here and the inference takes. longer (if you are a free user).

You can pay for faster GPUs if you are interested too.                           
***
###### ‎       
### Inference
In the context of **RVC**, is the process where a voice model is used to transform an audio, to make it sound like the model.       

In the world of **AI in general**, is the process where a model is used to transform the input data the model expects, into the data the model was trained to give.       
***
###### ‎       
### Local running
Running locally is a process that involves running apps in your own machine, using its resources.       

The opposite of [<u>cloud-based</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cloud-based).     
***
###### ‎       
### Open-source
Software who's original source code is made freely available to watch, distribute & modify.       
An open-source software can be seen as a positive thing since it's considered a sign of honesty & transparency.   

The opposite of [<u>closed-source</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#closed-source).     
***
###### ‎       
### Reverb
Is the sound caused by the soundwaves bouncing off the surfaces of a room, like when you talk in a bathroom, empty room or in a church.     
***
###### ‎       
### Specs
It refers to a computer's specifications. Hardware like [<u>GPU</u>](http://localhost:5000/Docs/other/glossary/#gpu), [<u>CPU</u>](http://localhost:5000/Docs/other/glossary/#cpu), RAM, etc.     
The performance of the hardware of a computer directly correlates to the performance of all its software.
