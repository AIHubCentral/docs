## Introduction
:::
- In this massive guide it will be explained how to **properly** prepare a dataset to make a RVC model.

- ***In the field of AI***, it's the collection of data used to train an AI model. It contains examples of the inputs the model is expected to handle, along with the correct outputs.

- **In the context of RVC**, it's an audio file that's given to RVC, containing the voice the model is going to replicate. It can be a speaking, singing voice drums, sound effects or noise.

- The **quality**, **variety** & **length** of the dataset are the biggest determining factors for the final quality of the model. Let's explain Length and Variety.
***
 ‚Äé
:::content-center
## Length & Variety
:::
- For beginners we recommend sticking with a dataset length of **15 minutes** of pure data not counting silence, or if you desire a natural sounding model go for **40+** minutes of dataset. Just remember **quality over quantity**.            

- **Variety** in your dataset is also important because without it RVC lacks the ability to generate diverse audio.

- Some things to increase the generalization abilities of RVC and increase the diversity in your dataset include:
    - Removing repeated words. ( If you want you can be extreme you can do this and remove every single repeated word that's fine, but generally there is no need to do this. )
    - Include speech in many ranges and pitches. 
    - Longer datasets.
    - Expressive speech.
***

## Quality  
:::

- A quality dataset is super important for RVC since without one RVC will struggle to make anything good or believable. 

:::content-center
#### ``Here are some recommendations for a quality dataset.``
:::

###### ‚Äé        
#### :icon-chevron-down: Clean vocals.
- Ensure there isn't much background noise, reverb, overlapping voices, music, distortion, or small silences. *Some* quiet natural background noise is fine and won't ruin your model since the original pretrains for RVC were made with a noisy dataset, so RVC knows how to deal with noise. You'll learn more on cleaning vocals in the **Vocal Isolation & Cleaning** section below.   
‚Äé   
#### :icon-chevron-down: Audio quality.
- The higher the audio quality, the better. If possible have it in a <u>[lossless](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#lossless-formats)</u> format like **WAV** or **FLAC**, not a lossy one like MP3. No converting a MP3 to a FLAC or WAV won't remove the compression.  
‚Äé   
#### :icon-chevron-down: No harsh sibilance/popping.
- Additionally, don't include harsh sibilance (loud "S" & "SH" pronunciation) or popping sounds (loud "P" sound) 
    - Robotic sibilances are due to your dataset being short or they are overfitted. You can fix this by making your dataset larger or by choosing an epoch where the sibilants aren't overfitted.
    - Harsh sibilances are due to your dataset having harsh sibilants. You can fix this by de-essing or making your dataset larger.
‚Äé  
#### :icon-chevron-down: No Audio Damage.
- The most inportant part of a clean dataset, if your audio is damaged RVC will struggle with it causing it to overall sound worse because RVC will create synthetic data and try to learn from it, so make sure your audio isn't damged.  
‚Äé   
***
:::content-center
## Artifacts 
:::       
In RVC, artifacting refers to an anomaly where the output voice sounds "robotic" & glitchy.     
This occurs after the <u>[inference](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#inference)</u> or model training process.     
#### Causes    
It usually occurs when the dataset/vocal sample meets any of these criteria: 

 ‚Ä¢  Audio is low-quality      
 ‚Ä¢  Voice model was overfitted, undertrained or overtrained        
 ‚Ä¢  There are overlapping voices      
 ‚Ä¢  There is reverb       
 ‚Ä¢  There is noise
             
As you noticed, most of the issues boil down to the audio sample not being properly **clean**. RVC is built for purely working with voices, not other sounds.         

Remember that the cleaner your input audio is, the better the results.

#### Solutions    
#### 1. Use a lossless format:
- If possible, it's best if your audio is in a <u>[lossless format](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#lossless-formats)</u> like **WAV** or **FLAC**, preserving its original quality.

- Avoid using lossy ones like MP3 or OGG.
‚Äé   
#### 2. If doing inference:
- Remove undesired noises with an <u>[vocal isolation</u>](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/) software.

- Lowering the <u>[search feature ratio</u>](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/inference-settings/) can also minimize this issue.

- If breathing sounds produce it, lower the <u>[Protection](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/inference-settings/)</u> value.
‚Äé   
#### 3. If training models:
- Ensure to <u>[clean your dataset](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/datasets/#cleaning-datasets)</u> properly, this includes removing silences and distortions.

## Vocal Isolation & Cleaning
:::  
- A vocal isolation app is a software designed to extract a person's vocals from an audio file, usually through the use of AI models.

- They can remove undesired noises, like background noise, reverb, echo, music, etc.    

- The goal is to get an audio sample with clean and natural vocals, which is what RVC needs to give the most accurate & quality results.

- For RVC users, the best app is Ultimate Vocal Remover 5 (or **UVR**). It can be used either <u>[locally](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#local-running)</u> or through the <u>[cloud](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/dataset-isolation/#cloud-uvr)</u>.

- If you want to remove noise manually to avoid ai artifacts you can use RX 11, which is mentioned in this guide.

### Troubleshooting :icon-tools:

***

==- *A model isn't there.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Click the wrench (üîß) on the left & go to `Download Center`
- Select the category of the model (MDX-NET or VR)
- Unfold its dropdown & select the model that you need
- Then click the download button (üì•). The model will download, which will take a few minutes
===

==- *UVR extracted too little/too much.*
###### ‚Äé
- Modify the `Aggression Setting` value on the right. 
- This determines the **depth** of the extraction. Only the **VR** method has it.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé
- Run the audio through BVE. Modify the <u>[Aggression Setting](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/#uvr-extracted-too-little-too-much)</u> if necessary.

### Important Notes ‚Äé :icon-alert:
***
- MVSEP is a website for isolating vocals, that works similarly as UVR.

- The <u>[UVR Colab](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/dataset-isolation/#cloud-uvr)</u> is much faster & convenient for this task. Use MVSEP if you run out of GPU runtime or feel lazy to convert your audio to WAV.

- For free users, you can't convert audios in batches or longer than 10 minutes. If that's your case, trim it into different pieces.

- There is a queue so make sure you make an account to skip most of it.

Vocals | MelBand Roformer | unwa big beta v5e
Instrumental | MelBand Roformer | unwa instrumental v1e
De-Reverb | Reverb Removal | Reverb removal by anvuew V2 (MelRoformer)
Extract Backing Vocals | MelBand Karaoke | Extract from vocals
De-Noise | DeNoise by aufr33  | Aggresive


### Troubleshooting ‚Äé :icon-tools:
***
==- *MVSEP extracted too much/too little.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Using the **Separation Type** of `DeNoise by aufr33`, you can modify the `Aggressiveness`. 
This determines the depth of the extraction.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Try running the audio through MelBand Karaoke or BVE. Modify the Aggression Setting if necessary.

## Preparing the dataset
:::

### Step 1: Find the Sample Rate
:::
- This is a unit in that defines the total amount of **samples** (data) that can **fit** within **1 second** of an audio. They are measured in kilohertz (kHz).

- The most common sample rates are **32, 40, 44.1, & 48**. The **higher** the sample rate, the more information it stores, therefore the higher the **quality**.  

- While training in RVC, you'll have to set the **target sample rate** as your dataset's. This value affects the final quality.  
   
- ##### A simple way to determine it is with <ins>Spek</ins>:  

    - ##### STEP 1:   
        Download and install Spek <u>[here</u>](https://www.spek.cc/p/download).        
    - ##### STEP 2:   
        Open spek and just drag & drop audio into it. 

        <img src="../audioformats-img/3.png" alt="image" width="500" height="auto">‚Äé   

    !!!danger <u>WARNING:</u>   
    If the frequencies don't reach the top of the spectrogram, see at which number peaks & multiply it by <U>**2**</u>. Here it reached 20 kHz. **Doubling** it gives 40kHz. Therefore the ideal target sample rate would be ``40k``
    !!!

### Step 2: Truncating Silence 

- Go to Effects -> Special -> Truncate Silence     
- Use the following values:

    <img src="../datasets-img/truncnew.png" alt="image" width="420" height="auto">    
    ***
    ‚Äé
    #### Step 2: Audio Normalization. (Optional)  
    - Go go to Effects -> Volume and Compression -> Loudness Normalization
    - Use these values:     
‚Äé       
<img src="../datasets-img/norm.png" alt="image" width="420" height="auto"> 

> LUFS are used over db because hifigan needs perceptual quality and db doesnt offer that.
***
### Step 3: Export
- On the upper right corner go to File and click ``Export Audio``.       
    ‚Äé   
    <img src="../datasets-img/4.png" alt="image" width="370" height="auto"> 
    ‚Äé       
    ‚Äé              

    - And finally, introduce these values:  
        - **Format**: ``WAV``
        - **Encoding**: ``32-Bit Float``
