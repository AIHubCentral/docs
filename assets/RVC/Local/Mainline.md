## Introduction ‎ :icon-book:
:::

- Mainline RVC is the base, original, & unmodified version of RVC. Made by the <u>[RVC-Project</u>](https://github.com/RVC-Project) team.

- It has less features compared to other <u>[forks</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/whats-rvc/#forks), but still has the necessary tools to do a decent job.

- It's specially liked because it's a little faster than other forks, as it's less bloated in a way. 

- Its actual name is not "Mainline", but it was given by the public to properly distinguish it from the other versions.     
‎

***
###### ‎  
#### 5. Process data.
Click the `Process Data` button on the center.      

RVC will process the previous criteria for the training.   
But also the dataset file, which might take a moment depending on how big it is.

<img src="../mainline-img/14.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">  

‎       

It'll finish when the output box on the right says ``end preprocess``.

### <u> Step 2b </u>
:::
###### ‎     
#### 6. Select GPUs.
In `Enter the GPU index(es)` determine which GPU(s) you'll use for training, by indicating the index followed by the dash (e.g: `0`).

<img src="../mainline-img/15.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‎  
#### 7. Select pitch extraction algorithm.
a. At the right select the <u>[**Pitch extraction algorithm**](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/inference-settings/#pitch-extraction-algorithm)</u>.       
Only use ``RMVPE_GPU`` or ``Crepe``, as the rest are obsolete.      

    <img src="../mainline-img/16.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto"> ‎      

###### ‎   
b. Now click the `Feature extraction` button on the right.

***
###### ‎     
:::content-center
### <u> Step 3 </u>
:::
###### ‎           
#### 9. Select save frequency.
Frequency of the <u>[saving checkpoints](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#checkpoints)</u>, based on the <u>[epochs](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/training/#tensorboard)</u>.        

If you are a newbie, simply leave it at `15`.        
    
E.g: with a value of ``10``, they will be saved after the epoch 10, 20, 30, etc.    

‎   
<img src="../mainline-img/18.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">

***
###### ‎  
#### 10. Input epochs amount.
In `Total training epochs` you determine the total amount of <u>[epochs](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/training/#epochs--overtraining)</u> (training cycles) for the model.     

But since we'll use [TensorBoard](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/training/#tensorboard), use an arbitrarily large value like `2000`.

<img src="../mainline-img/19.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‎  
#### 11. Select batch size.
Leave `Batch size per GPU` at `8` if you aren't familiar with it.
  
If your dataset is short (around 2 minutes or less), use ``4`` instead.

<img src="../mainline-img/20.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‎  
#### 12. Launch TensorBoard.
Now before you start training, open TB.     

If you haven't already, start reading about it here <u><u>[here</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/training/#tensorboard)</u>.
***
###### ‎  
#### 13. Begin training.
Start training the model by clicking `Train model`.

<img src="../mainline-img/21.png" alt="image" width="250" height="auto">‎   
‎   
‎   
Remember to monitor TB, & also the console just in case.    
The latter will show you errors if they happen, and information about the epochs & checkpoints.  
‎   
<img src="../mainline-img/j.png" alt="image" width="550" height="auto"> 

***
###### ‎  
#### 14. Stop training.
When you are very sure of overtraining, you can stop training by pressing the `Stop training` button where `Train model` used to be.        

***
###### ‎  
#### 15. Gather model's files.
a. Create a new folder anywhere named as your model.

a. Open RVC's folder, go to ``logs``, and open the folder named with the model.       
Select the `.INDEX` named ``added_`` & move it to your newly made folder.

    <img src="../mainline-img/c.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

‎   

c. Now go to the ``weights`` folder. Here you'll find the model's <u>[checkpoints](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#checkpoints)</u>.      

    Select the one **closest** to ***before*** the overtraining point, and move it to the new folder      


    These files will be organized with this format: **ModelName_Epoch_Step.pth**   
    Example: ``kalomaze_e60_s120.pth``

    <img src="../mainline-img/d.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto"> ‎  
    ‎            

    And that's all. Have fun with your model.   
    To test the model, do a normal <u>[inference</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/how-to-make-ai-cover/) as usual.

***
###### ‎   
:::content-center
### <u>Resuming</u> :icon-sync:
:::
###### ‎   
If the training finished but the model still needed training, you don't have to start from scratch.       
**Follow this procedure:**

- Simply enter the **same settings and criteria** that you previously inserted. Model name, sample rate, dataset, batch size, etc. You don't have to press ``Process Data`` or train the <u>[.INDEX</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/voice-models/#voice-model-files) again.

- You can change the **save frequency**, or increase the **epochs** amount in case you didn't input enough before.

- Begin training again & remember to monitor TB & console like before.

## Troubleshooting :icon-tools:
:::
###### ‎ 
==- *There's no option for my sample rate.*
###### ‎   

- **If it's lower than <u>32k**</u>: select ``32k``.     
‎   
- **If it's <u> 32k**</u>: on the right in <u>Version</u>, press `v1` & press `v2` again. Ensure you leave it as `v2`. You should be able to see a `32k` option now.        
‎   
- **If it's <u>44.1k**</u>: select ``40k``.   
‎   
- **If i'ts higher than <u>48k</u>**: select ``48k``.

===

==- *The voice glitches out.*
###### ‎   
- This a phenomenon called artifacting. To fix it, read <u>[here](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/dataset-isolation/#artifacts)</u>.

===

==- *I don't see the Stop Training button.*
- This is a common bug. Close the console to stop RVC entirely.
===

==- *I couldn't find my answer.*
