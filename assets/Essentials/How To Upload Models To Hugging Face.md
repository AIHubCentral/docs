#### 1. <u>Zip the model.</u>         
Select your model's ``.PTH`` and ``.INDEX`` and [<u>zip</u>](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5) them into a **.ZIP** file.       
Ensure it's .ZIP and not .RAR or .7ZIP.

Be sure to grab the correct files, as newbies sometimes use incorrect ones.
