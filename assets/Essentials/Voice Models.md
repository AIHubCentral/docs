## What is a Voice Model
:::
- ***In the field of AI***, is a program that was trained to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions.

- **In this case**, voice models are models trained to **replicate** a voice, and with AI they apply it to the input audio.

- There are plenty of them uploaded to the internet, made by the public. And the best way to make them is with <u>[RVC</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/how-to-make-voice-models/)</u>.   

###### â€Ž   
### Voice Model Files 
==- *They are made up of two files:*       
###### â€Ž    
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>PTH:</u>   
- This file is the model itself.
- Contains data regarding pitch.     
- While training, RVC generates other .PTHs named `D_` and `G_`, but these are the <u>[checkpoints](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#checkpoints)</u>, not usable models.  
###### â€Ž       
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>INDEX:</u>
- Contains data regarding the voice's accent and speech manner.       
- File is additional, but usually **crucial** for the **quality** of the model.        
- While training, RVC generates two .INDEX file, but the right one will be named ``added_`` by default.

!!!warning *Be sure to upload the correct files mentioned before.*
As people sometimes upload them incorrectly.

- This a website where people can upload voice models.
- Models uploaded in **AI Hub** get automatically stored here too.  
- Users can read/share feedback about the models through comments & likes.     
***
###### â€Ž
#### 1. Log in 
- Access the website <u>[here</u>](https://weights.com/models) & login by clicking the icon on the top right corner.
***
###### â€Ž
#### 2. Search

!!!
If you get models from different years, remember, the person's voice changes overtime.
!!!
***
###### â€Ž
#### 3. Evaluate model (optional)      
- Check the description, likes, comments, & audio sample. Feedback can help you know how great the model is.        
- The sample of the gender & vocal style according to the model gives the most accurate representation.     
- This step is specially useful if you get multiple results of the same model.
