## What is a Voice Model
:::
- ***In the field of AI***, is a program that was trained to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions.

- **In this case**, voice models are models trained to **replicate** a voice, and with AI they apply it to the input audio.

- There are plenty of them uploaded to the internet, made by the public. And the best way to make them is with <u>[RVC</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/how-to-make-voice-models/)</u>.   

###### ‚Äé   
### Voice Model Files 
==- *They are made up of two files:*       
###### ‚Äé    
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>INDEX:</u>   
- Contains data regarding the voice's accent and speech manner.       
- File is additional, but usually **crucial** for the **quality** of the model.        
- While training, RVC generates two .INDEX file, but the right one will be named ``added_`` by default.         
###### ‚Äé       
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>PTH:</u>
- This file is the model itself.
- Contains data regarding pitch.     
- While training, RVC generates other .PTHs named `D_` and `G_`, but these are the <u>[checkpoints](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#checkpoints)</u>, not usable models.
