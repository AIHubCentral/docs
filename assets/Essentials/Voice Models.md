## What is a Voice Model
:::
- ***In the field of AI***, is a program that was trained to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions.

- **In this case**, voice models are models trained to **replicate** a voice, and with AI they apply it to the input audio.

- There are plenty of them uploaded to the internet, made by the public. And the best way to make them is with <u>[RVC</u>](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/how-to-make-voice-models/)</u>.   

###### ‎   
### Voice Model Files 
==- *They are made up of two files:*       
###### ‎    
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>PTH:</u>   
- This file is the model itself.
- Contains data regarding pitch.     
- While training, RVC generates other .PTHs named `D_` and `G_`, but these are the <u>[checkpoints](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#checkpoints)</u>, not usable models.  
###### ‎       
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>INDEX:</u>
- Contains data regarding the voice's accent and speech manner.       
- File is additional, but usually **crucial** for the **quality** of the model.        
- While training, RVC generates two .INDEX file, but the right one will be named ``added_`` by default.         
***
!!!warning *Be sure to upload the correct files mentioned before.*
As people sometimes upload them incorrectly.

# Goodbye to Weights

After much reflection, we’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Weights, Voyages, and our family of apps on **March 31st, 2026**.

# What to Know

**Before March 31st, 2026:**
- Download any content, models, or creations you want to keep
- Request a full data export from your account settings
- Active subscriptions will be canceled automatically
- Credits can be used until the shutdown date

**After March 31st, 2026:**
- The website, apps, and all services will be permanently offline
- Content and accounts will no longer be accessible
- Support for Weights, Voyages, and other products will end

#  Replay

[Replay](https://www.weights.com/replay) is not affected by this shutdown. It will remain available and usable, though no new updates will be released. **NOTE:** Since Replay needs to download required files, it might not work if you didn't set it up before the shutdown.

# ❤️ Thank You

Thank you for being part of the Weights community. We’ve loved seeing what you built and how you pushed the boundaries of AI creativity. This platform wouldn’t have existed without you.

# ❓ Questions
If you need help with exports, subscriptions, or anything else, contact us at support@weights.com or here on the Discord server. We'll be here until the end.

###### ‎
#### 3. Evaluate model (optional)      
- Check the description, likes, comments, & audio sample. Feedback can help you know how great the model is.        
- The sample of the gender & vocal style according to the model gives the most accurate representation.     
- This step is specially useful if you get multiple results of the same model.
