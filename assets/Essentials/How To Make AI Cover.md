###### ‎
### 1. Extract vocals
- Have the audio file of your song ready, & let's **extract** the vocals from it with an **audio isolation** software.

- RVC is designed to work with only voices, so to get the best results the sample must be **clean**, without undesired noises.

- #### <u>[Learn how](https://docs.aihub.gg/rvc/resources/dataset-isolation/)</u>.

### 2. Get voice model
- Learn about them & how to search one <u>[here](https://docs.aihub.gg/essentials/voice-models/)</u>. Be sure to leave credits to the model maker.

### :icon-check: Tips
- Congratulations, you've made it to the final part. Now it's to mix the song.       
‎   
- You're free to use any <u>[DAW](https://docs.aihub.gg/extra/glossary/#daw)</u>, but we recommend **FL Studio** or **BandLab**, as they are beginner-friendly. You can start by searching some of their mixing tutorials on YouTube.      
‎   
- **Recommendations for the mix:**     
    - Match the volume of the vocals to the same level as the original ones.      
    - Add reverb to the vocals (not to the instrumental), to the same level as the original one.          
    - Add delay if the original vocals had it.        
    - Remove the very low frequencies, ranging from 20 to 100.        
    - For presence and clarity, increase the high range a bit.        
    - Normalize the audio.           
    - Use compressor on vocals.     
‎   
- Regarding what to do with the **backing vocals**, you have 4 options:
    1. Simply leave the original ones in.
    2. Record yourself singing them & convert the audio with RVC.
    3. Make vocals from scratch using a voice synthesizer (like SynthV) & convert them with RVC.
