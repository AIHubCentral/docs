***

###### ‎
### 1. Extract vocals
- Have the audio file of your song ready, & let's **extract** the vocals from it with an **audio isolation** software.

- RVC is designed to work with voices only, so to get the best results the sample must be **clean**, with no undesired noises.

- #### <u>[Learn how](https://docs.aihub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/)</u>.

### :icon-check: Tips
- Congratulations, you've made it to the final part. Now it's to mix the song.       
‎   
- You're free to use any <u>[DAW](https://docs.aihub.wtf/extra/glossary/#daw)</u>, but we recommend **FL Studio** or **BandLab**, as they are beginner-friendly. You can start by searching some of their mixing tutorials on YouTube.      
‎   
- **Recommendations for the mix:**     
    - Match the volume of the vocals to the same level as the original ones.      
    - Add reverb to the vocals (not to the instrumental), to the same level as the original one.          
    - Add delay if the original vocals had it.        
    - Remove the very low frequencies, ranging from 20 to 100.        
    - For presence and clarity, increase the high range a bit.        
    - Normalize the audio.           
    - Use compressor on vocals.     
‎   
- Regarding what to do with the **backing vocals**, you have 4 options:
    1. Simply leave the original ones in.
    2. Convert them using <u>[Mangio-Crepe](https://docs.aihub.wtf/rvc/resources/inference-settings/#mangio-crepe)</u> with a higher hop length.
    3. Record yourself singing them & convert the audio with RVC.
    4. Make vocals from scratch using a voice synthesizer (like SynthV) & convert them with RVC.
